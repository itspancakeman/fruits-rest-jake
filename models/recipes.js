            "2 small baguettes or 1 ciabatta loaf",
            "50g softened butter",
            "3 garlic cloves (crushed)",
            "2 tbsp chopped parsley",
            "2 tbsp grated parmesan",
        ],
        steps: [
            "If using baguettes, slice diagonally along the top at 2-3cm intervals, ensuring you do not cut all the way through. If using a ciabatta loaf, cut in half crosswise through the middle, then split each piece in half through the equator (as though you are creating mini pizzas).",
            "Mix together the softened butter, garlic and parsley to fully combine. Heat the air-fryer to 180C.",
            "Spread the garlic butter into the cuts of the baguettes or over the cut sides of the ciabatta, then sprinkle over the cheese, if using. If you are worried about butter dripping into the air-fryer, put the bread on a sheet of foil, then transfer to the air-fryer basket and bake for 8-10 mins until golden and crunchy, and the cheese has browned. You may need to do this in batches, depending on the size of the basket.",

            "85g paremsan (grated)",
            "20g flat leaf parsley",

        steps: [
            "Begin by cooking the pasta following pack instructions. Meanwhile, melt the butter in your largest frying pan. Once foaming, add the garlic and 25 twists of a black pepper mill. Cook for 4-5 mins, until the garlic is light golden and fragrant.",
            "Stir in the flour to form a paste. Stir for 1-2 mins, then slowly whisk in the chicken stock until you have a smooth sauce. Pour in the double cream and sprinkle in most of the parmesan. Stir until everything is melted and combined, then season to taste.",
            "Transfer the pasta straight into the sauce, alongside a good splash of the cooking water. Mix thoroughly, adding a little more pasta water if necessary, until you have a thick and glossy sauce.",

            "Heat the oil and butter in a medium non-stick frying pan over a medium-low heat. Once the butter has started to foam, pour in the eggs and tilt to cover the base of the pan. Using a spatula, gently draw in the eggs from four points so there are folds in the centre. Do this once or twice, then leave the eggs to cook gently for 2-3 mins, until there's a little raw egg still in the middle. Sprinkle over the cheese and, using your spatula, gently fold the omelette in half. Switch off the heat and let the residual heat from the pan melt the cheese for 1 min. Slide onto your plate and sprinkle over some black pepper to serve.",
